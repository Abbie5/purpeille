A journey of allegiance; endgame resource expansion

## About

This mod aims to provide a definitive endgame resource beyond Netherite for semi-vanilla experiences. Purpeille is by far the most difficult resource to gather, but it's worth the effort: it provides a base for a completely dynamic bonus system.

The mod's progression begins when you enter the End dimension and have Netherite gear at the least. The advancements should reveal the next steps, but for in-depth explanations, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/acikek/purpeille/wiki).
